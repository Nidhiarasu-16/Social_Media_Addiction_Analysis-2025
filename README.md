# Social Media Addiction Analysis – 2025

Project Overview : This project presents a data-driven analysis of social media addiction among students using an interactive analytics dashboard. The dashboard visualizes behavioral patterns, platform usage, sleep trends, academic conflicts, and addiction scores across demographics such as age, gender, country, and education level. The aim is to derive meaningful insights from structured data using visual analytics techniques to support awareness, academic research, and decision-making.

Objective :
  - To analyze social media usage patterns among students
  - To measure addiction severity using quantitative indicators
  - To study the relationship between social media usage, sleep, and academic conflicts
  - To present insights through an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard

Dataset Description :
  - Total Students Analyzed: 705
  - Attributes include:
      1. Age
      2. Gender
      3. Country
      4. Daily social media usage hours
      5. Average sleep duration
      6. Addiction score
      7. Academic level
      8. Platform-wise usage

Tools & Technologies Used :
  1. Data Visualization Dashboard Tool
  2. Data Analytics and Statistical Aggregation
  3. Interactive Filters and Slicers
  4. Map-based Geographical Visualization
  5. Chart Types:
      - Column charts
      - Donut charts
      - Pie charts
      - Gauge indicators
      - Geographical maps

Dashboard Components :
  1. Total number of students analyzed
  2. Average hours of sleep per day
  3. Average social media usage per day
  4. Average addiction score indicator
  5. Country-wise mental health score comparison
  6. Platform-wise usage distribution
  7. Academic-level based conflict analysis
  8. Age and gender-based interactive slicers

Key Insights :
  1. Average daily social media usage is approximately 4.92 hours
  2. The average sleep duration is around 6.87 hours
  3. Instagram and TikTok show the highest usage percentages
  4. Undergraduate students experience the highest social-media-related academic conflicts
  5. Certain regions show consistently higher addiction scores
  6. Increased usage correlates with reduced sleep duration

How to Use the Dashboard :
  - Use the age range slider to filter specific age groups
  - Apply gender filters to compare behavioral patterns
  - Analyze country-wise trends using the geographical map
  - Observe platform usage distribution through donut charts
  - Review addiction severity using the gauge indicator

Outcome :
  - Clear visualization of social media addiction trends
  - Identification of high-risk student groups
  - Strong correlation insights between usage, sleep, and academics
  - Interactive dashboard suitable for presentations and analysis

Applications :
  - Academic research and case studies
  - Mental health awareness programs
  - Student behavior analysis
  - Policy and educational interventions
  - Data analytics portfolio projects

Future Enhancements :
  - Predictive modeling for addiction risk
  - Machine learning-based clustering of user behavior
  - Time-series analysis of usage patterns
  - Integration with real-time survey data
  - Automated insight generation
